        An app I developed for the sole purpose of counting the tomatoes that were picked off of of a plant growing on my balcony each day. It includes an area to quickly add the quantity from your mobile phone. You can also view the total picked, total average, and view a report of all of the past times that you've picked tomatoes which includes the quantity and date.
